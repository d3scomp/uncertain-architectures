/**
 * The building class also has capacity and type, therefore it could be a vehicle if we were using duck typing.
 * It could also implement VehicleRole, but it does not, since it is semantically incorrect. Therefore, there
 * will be no Person-Building ensembles (see {@link ConvoyEnsemble}). However, if you try to add the {@link PlaysRole}
 * annotation to the Building class, even Buildings will serve as vehicles and the ensembles with Person could be created.
 * 
 * See {@link BoardingEnsemble} for more details.
